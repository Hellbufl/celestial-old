A path timing tool for NieR: Automata speedrunning

It's probably still very buggy so please feel free to report any weird behavior to me here or on Discord in the DrakeNieR Server: [sponsoredbydrakengard.com](https://sponsoredbydrakengard.com) \
A big big thank you to [Woeful Wolf](https://github.com/WoefulWolf/) for helping me with the hooking, rendering and just generally getting me started on this!

Instructions on how to use this tool will follow.
